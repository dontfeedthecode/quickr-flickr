Quickr Flickr
=============

#### What is this?

QuickrFlickr is a Flickr photo browser quickly thrown together by Tim Sheehan (@dontfeedthecode) in 8 hours. It uses an extremely light weight and restrictive custom MVC framework and custom Flickr class.

*Technology used:*

```PHP5```

```Twig Templates```

```HTML5```

```CSS3```

```Modernizr```

```Less CSS```

```jQuery```

#### Installation

QuickrFlickr will run out of the box when put into a folder called "yahoo" in the web root, e.g. /public_html/yahoo. If you want to run QuickrFlickr from another location you must edit .htacesss and the Twig variable base_url in views/base.html.
